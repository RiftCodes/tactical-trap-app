Each release has a thousand things going on.  Changes to critical assumptions or the infrastructure
are recorded here to help understand breaking changes.

Cordova -> Capacitor migration notes:

  cordova requirements: {
    "plugins": {
x      "cordova-plugin-statusbar": {},
x      "cordova-plugin-device": {},
x      "cordova-plugin-splashscreen": {},
x      "cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard": {},

      "cordova-plugin-ble-central": {
        "BLUETOOTH_USAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Bluetooth access must be enabled to connect to Tactical Traps locks."
      },
x      "cordova-plugin-android-permissions": {},
-      "cordova-plugin-ionic-webview": {}
    }
  }

  for capacitor, use:

      npm install @capacitor/status-bar
      npx cap sync

      > Note the info.plist requirements mentioned in https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/status-bar

      npm install @capacitor/splash-screen
      npx cap sync

      > Consider calling this in home.page.ts ngAfterViewInit()

      npm install @capacitor/keyboard

      > Appears this again is a default plugin.  Never referenced in the app.

      npm install @capacitor/app

      > Also pre-installed?

      npm install @capacitor/browser

      > Need to investigate if the return button setup is still required

      npm install @capacitor/preferences
      npm install @capacitor/device

      npm install cordova-plugin-nativeclicksound

      > This plugin is rather old, might be superseded by Haptics plugin, and
        needs to be tested to see if it does anything now

      npm install @ionic-native/android-permissions
      npm install cordova-plugin-android-permissions

      > The ble-central plugin now contains Android permissions logic built into
        it.  Pull request 771 gives an iOS permissions function that may have
        some bearing on the current BLE iOS setup code.

      npm install @ionic-native/ble
      npm install cordova-plugin-ble-central

      > Capacitor doesn't run the plugin hooks, so the following needs to be added
        to the info.plist file under the appropriate keys:

      --variable BLUETOOTH_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="Bluetooth access must be enabled to connect to Tactical Traps locks."


      ==== V1.3.5 ===

      - Rollup of changes needed to harden app against unplanned user inputs:
        impatient button presses, double activations, and the like.  Fixed
        initial connection sequence that took too long.  Finished switch from
        reading statuses to getting status notifications, allowing the locks
        to dictate the command timing.

      ==== V1.4.0 ====

      - Devices aren't showing up when scanning on Android 12.  Infrastructure was recently upgraded to V11, so
        fewer things are impacted.
        * In Android Studio, upgraded SDK platform tools to v33.0.2
        * Added SDK 31
        * Discovered Capacitor 4 has been released - they sure aren't making it obvious.
          >  npm i -D @capacitor/cli@latest
          >  npx cap migrate
          Looks like migrate did most or all of the conversion steps in the upgrade list.
          >  npm install @capacitor/preferences
          >  npm remove @capacitor/Storage
        * Capacitor targets SDK 32
          - added SDK 32
          - removed sources for SDK 29
          - removed SDK 30.0.2
        * Added @capacitor/device to get OS info
        * Updated BLE permissions code to work on Android 12+

      ==== V1.4.1 ====
        - recover-from-crash-feature branch: looking for solution to locks
          being left in limbo when user force stops the app
        - added signal strength meter to options page
